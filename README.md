## How the Game Works

`2Serious` is an action-packed game where you traverse through three distinct levels, battling zombie enemies to reclaim the land. Here's how to get started:

2. **Gameplay**: Use the AWSD keys or the arrow keys to move backward and side to side. Fight off zombies and progress through the levels to take back the land.
3. **Market and Upgrades**: Points earned from defeating zombies can be used in the market to purchase better armor and machinery, increasing your survival odds and combat effectiveness.
