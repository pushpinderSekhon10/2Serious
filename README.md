## How the Game Works

`2Serious` is an action-packed game where you traverse through three distinct levels, battling zombie enemies to reclaim the land. Here's how to get started:

1. **Starting the Game**: After launching the game, you’ll be greeted with the main menu. From here, you can start your journey, adjust settings, or explore other options.
2. **Gameplay**: Use the AWSD keys or the arrow keys to move backward and side to side. Fight off zombies and progress through the levels to take back the land.
3. **Market and Upgrades**: Points earned from defeating zombies can be used in the market to purchase better armor and machinery, increasing your survival odds and combat effectiveness.
4. **Winning the Game**: To win, successfully conquer all three levels and eliminate the zombie threat. Strategy and the effective use of your earned points are key to your success.
