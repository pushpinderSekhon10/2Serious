Collectibles:
1. Create GameObjects for player, coins, xp source.
2. Add Character Controller to player and Rigidbody physics component to objects collected by collision (adjust colliders as necessary).
3. Add tags to each object to recognize when collision on trigger has been activated
4. Create ResourceManager script with corresponding player attributes (score, xp, currentHealth, healthCapacity, damage per attack).
5. Create player script which inherits resource manager and add methods to detect collision/proximity events and update corresponding resource.
6. Create scripts for each type of object (ex. collisionCoins, proximityCoins, XPSource) and write methods to detect when event activated based on event with player and destroy collected object.
7. Add a method to generate a random x, y, and z coordinate for the object to be positioned at when the game starts. Call another IsPositionOccupied method within the location generation method in a loop to regenerate w new location while the current one is occupied until an empty location is found. Call this generate location method in the start method.


Shop:
8. Create a panel (should automatically create a canvas if not already there) named Shop. 
9. Under canvas -> UI Scalar, set UI Scale mode to Scale with screen size so UI elements scaled for different screen sizes, set reference resolution x to 1920 y to 1080, im pretty sure thats what the TA said we couuld use as reference
10.
